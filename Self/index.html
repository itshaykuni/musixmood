	<h1>IT'S HAYKUNI</h1>
	<h2>subtle attempts to tell you about the way I feel life.</h2>
	<h3>ON HOPE</h3>
	<p>I've always noticed that my dreams come true eventually. No matter how hard the times get, how many difficulties I meet on my way, how desperate I get from time to time, no matter how sadly I let go of hope. Actually I don't. The last minute, when I'm ready to turn over and leave my attempts of getting or arranging something, Karma runs into me herself. It's as if she was chasing to catch me and give my reward of pure wish and hard work, but I was being so panicky and confused that she was loosing the track of me. <br> It's all in the moment you feel crossed out of her plans that she find you and awards you. I've learnet that. The lesson is stretching its roots deeper and deeper in my brain. And wondering if I am some sort of favorite or the relationship with her is the same for everybody, I express my silent gratitude to her and the Universe that has created me.</p>
